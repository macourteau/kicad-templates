# KiCad 6 Project Templates

KiCad 6 project templates for various fabs.

These are my best guesses at correct specifications for various fabs/PCB services, based on their documentation. Improvements welcome if there are any issues!

## Usage

To use these, either change KiCad's user templates directory to the root directory of your checkout, or copy these into KiCad's `template` directory.

If you are using macOS or Linux, you can symlink your `template` directory to point to your checkout.

From KiCad's main window, you can choose `File` > `New Project From Template...`, then choose the template you'd like to start from.
